# Maximum likelihood estimation

In statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the paramters of an assumed probability distribution, given some observed data. This is archieved by maximizing a likehood function so that, under the assumed statistical model, the observed data is most probable.

The likelihood function describles the join probability of the observed data as a function of the paramters of the chosen statistical model.

In each specific paramter value $\theta$ in the paramter space, the likelihood function $p(y|\theta)$ therefore assigns a probilistic prediction to the observed data $y$. Since it is essentially the product of sampling densities, the likelihood generally encapsulates both the data-generating process as well as the missing-data mechanism that produced the observed sample.
